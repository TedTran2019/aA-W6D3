# aA-W6D3
App Academy's Full Stack Online: W6D3, Javascript, AJAX. Ajax Twitter!

Adding a README just so I can remind myself of how painful this week was.

W5D4 -> First day of Javascript. A combination of jury duty plus how boringly slow Codecademy was made this take forever. 
- Estimation: 4-5 days to complete due to jury duty cutting into half of the day for an entire week 

W6D3 -> A lesson learned-- always get your flu shots every year. Got horribly sick and could barely function for a week,
and I also feel the way the AJAX-Twitter project was planned was extremely weak.
- Estimation: 8-9 days. Taking days off because of sickness, only studying 1 hour/day when recovering, then falling off
track due to bad habits formed while sick. However, getting back up to 5 minimum, 8 ideal hours/day studying levels once more.
