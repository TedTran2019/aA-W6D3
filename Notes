Backend -> Rails!
Frontend -> Browsers!

Ajax -> Async Javascript and XML
- browser can make a HTTP request to server w/o throwing away what it already has
- responses with JSON instead
- most expensive is waiting for server to respond, loading things/reading files
- How?
	a. first send is HTML that has script source tags
	b. JS code makes AJAX requests
	c. Reponses from Rails include only JSON, not assets/HTML
	d. all AJAX knows is that status codes from Rails
	e. doesn't have to be jQuery to do AJAX!

Instead of POST request, AJAX Request
- #find only looks within one section
- use preventDefault
- $.ajax(function w/ method, url, dataType, data, success and error functions)
- in Rails: respond_to do |format| .....
- success callback gets arguments

Adding a spinner!
- google css spinner, then put in the html/css lmao

#serialize method in Ruby!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic AJAX
- Old method: forms submitted to server in HTTP request, redirects browser to
	request another page, browse fetches and renders new content
- Achieve better functionality when you don't need to be redirected (URL is the same),
	is to make a HTTP request in background, aka browser request aka AJAX request
	a. browser fires a JS callback function
- it's called AJAX because XML is old standard, but JSON is the standard now.
- servers can respond to any format, aka text JS html JSON pdf etc
- although AJAX provided by browser, jQuery is used to paper over differences
	and profit from a nice interface
	a. $.ajax, $.get, $.post
	b. https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
	c. Recall that jQuery is being replaced by frameworks and AJAX maybe replaced
		by fetch API?
	d. $.ajax accepts options object
	e. https://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/ajax/
		- e.g understand how it works rather than just using a wrapper
		- GO BACK TO THIS, DON'T LET jQuery BE A CRUTCH

AJAX Remote Forms
- jQuery comes with a serialize method which translates a set of form elements as
	a URL encoded string
- $.ajax accepts Object and Array data types for its data property. We can use
	the serializeJSON jQuery plug-in to add a serializeJSON method to jQuery.
- gem 'serialize_json-rails'
- and then load the file (after jQuery) in app/assets/javascripts/application.js:
- //= require serialize_json
- authenticity token? Rails will automatically include a JavaScript library named
	rails.js in your application.js file. Among a number of other things, this will
	install a $.ajaxPrefilter; this filter gets run before every AJAX request.
- $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content');

Using Rails as an API
- client-side rendering
- when a web server provides non-UI formatted info, we call it a web API

API: A **server-side web API** is a programmatic interface consisting of one or
	more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request-response message system

- To make Rails an API, we're going to rewrite those views so that they serve up
	raw JSON information instead of HTML; we'll call these views endpoints.

Static HTML implementation:
1. render :index, renders index.html.erb when controller action is hit

API implementation:
1.  If a request with a header for Accept: application/json comes in,
	CatsController#index will automatically try to render
	app/views/cats/index.json.jbuilder
	- e.g json.array! @cats
	- Jbuilder. It's just a gem that lets us write Ruby code to create JSON objects
https://blog.bigbinary.com/2010/11/23/mime-type-resolution-in-rails.html
2. accept header -> MIME types as content types
	- when making an AJAX GET request, if no dataType specified, any response is ok
	- if set to JSON, then the accept header will be application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
3. controller's respond_to do |format|....

Promises
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
- Much cleaner and shorter way to write/chain async functions
- action: the primary function of a promise (i.e., fetch data from an API)
- 3 states: pending, fulfilled, rejected...
	- considered settled when fulfilled or rejected
- a promise can only succeed or fail once, callbacks will not b invoked multiple times
- a promise cannot change its state from fulfilled to rejected or vice versa
- if a promise already settled and a callbacka dded that matches the state it's
	invoked immediately
- e.g const p = new Promise(executor); , executor is a function that takes in two
	optional parameters; resolve and reject
	- resolve and reject tells the promises what args to pass on once promise settled
- Two important pre-defined methods: then and catch, both return a new promise obj
	making them chainable
- then accepts onFulfilled and onRejected
	- e.g onFulfilled is like resolve and onRejected is like reject
- catch only accepts onRejected... onRejected would have to throw error, not just
	log one obv.
- jQuery ajax object allows use of success callbacks and returns a jqXHR object,
	which can be used like a promise. Can avoid passing a callback to ajax by calling
	then on return value then passing callback to then
	- notice how the jQuery jqXHR object takes then and fail, instead of then and catch
	- jqXHR also has done (only success) and always (settled === run)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28703241/promise-constructor-with-reject-call-vs-throwing-error
reject is a callback, while throw can't be used async
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all
When all promises need to be fulfilled in no particular order, Promise.all()
https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise
Polyfill of es6 promise!
- A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide
	modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises
- Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object—keyup,
	touchstart etc. With those events you don't really care about what happened before
	you attached the listener
- if a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback,
	 the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.
- jQuery deferreds aren't Promise compliant, thus different and less useful
	- can cast into standard promises
	- e.g var jsPromise = Promise.resolve($.ajax('/whatever.json'))
	- Notice how XMLHttpRequest is used instead of jQuery
		- req = new XMLHttpRequest(), #open, #onload, #response, #statusText, #onerror,
			#send (These are all from req, the instance of XMLHttpRequest)
		- can make a function to do it all then not deal with it again
		- think of then always returning promise, but with the value being whateva u want
- chaining async actions
- With then(func1, func2), func1 or func2 will be called, never both. But with
	then(func1).catch(func2), both will be called if func1 rejects, as they're
	separate steps in the chain.
- Rejections happen when a promise is explicitly rejected, but also implicitly if
	 an error is thrown in the constructor callback:
Parallelism and sequencing: getting the best of both
- Write as synchronous, then just add then() to make things happen one after
	the other
Creating a sequence
- start off with a promise that always resolves
- loop thru and add the actions to end of sequence

Generators
- star b4 function name === generator, yield is return/resume point
- helper function that allows using yield to wait for promises to settle
- pattern is so useful it's coming to ES7... basically put 'async' before
	function to make it an async function, then can use await within the function
	- always returns a promise
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions
for (etc of etc)... loop?
- async functions always return promise
- await means to wait until that promise settles and returns its result
- await accepts thenables
- try...catch
- works well with PRomise.all()
https://javascript.info/async-await

$.ajax -> type, url, datatype, data, success/error functions, etc... Look at documentation!
http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
- JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
- can do jsonp data type in case request fails, since XHR to other domains
	tends to be blocked by browser. jsonp is JSON with padding

Know how AJAX requests allow the frontend and backend to communicate
Be able to change the backend of an app by sending an AJAX request
Be able to change the frontend of an app with data from an AJAX response
Be able to write AJAX requests in an API Util file
Be able to write basic Jbuilder views
Know the basics of how promises work

- Rails doesn't intelligently manage dependencies, so you still have to be extra
	careful about the load order.
- jquery, jquery_ujs, jquery.serializejson, require_tree .
- application.js -> Rails manifes file similar to script tags in HTML but
	Rails compiles them all into a single file for production. After requiring
	tree (to require files in app/assets/javascripts), don't need to compile
	JS files again bc Webpack will do.

Hmm, setting up jQuery, Webpack/JS, and in the future, React....
- Reference AJAX gemfile for additional gems to use and learn

Seems that AJAX is easy, esp. when using jQuery.
- Learning promises, jQuery deferred, and async...await
- #prop is insanely useful

Jesus, had an excuse first day-- was horribly sick so just played League and relaxed.
But second day, was only mildly sick and I played League for 5 hours. A massive
waste of time-- under no circumstances, even under conditions where you can't study,
should you play. It doesn't make you happy, feel accomplished, or do anything
but make you miserable and waste time. Do things that make you feel happy
and accomplished-- programming, exercise, cooking, time with gf, time with friends,
anime, air hockey, the arcade, badminton, drawing, whatever else... Also,
health first. Take breaks, spend the first hour of the day on food/water/skincare/hygiene
and focus on your life. You can't just wake up in the morning then just study 8 hours
straight with nearly no breaks. There's no point being a programmer if your body
and eyes are ruined after. Focus on being present, self aware, and grateful. Think
about your thoughts and actions, and the consequences they'll have on you in the present
and future...

Etc.none is pretty interesting and clean to say 'nothing'.

#scan is extremely useful-- REGEX matching. Look at how it was used to split a
string into 8s easily, and think of other applications.

Prioritize health -> studying -> networking/entertainment.
Another day wasted, 1 day of 3.5 hours and 3 days of 0 hours of studying. What a
massive mess. This combined with jury duty has taken me off schedule a ton.
Get started on matters asap, focus, and don't procrastinate.

#find, #append, #val, #preventDefault
addMessage, clearForm -> not jQuery
https://api.jquery.com/find/
https://api.jquery.com/val/
input event, hmmm.
#empty vs #remove, first removes all child elements, other removes self + all children
jbuilder is really useful.

Then grabs the resolved value of the promise!
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then
Takes in a success and failure callback.

Interesting-- found my mistake. Notice how in users_controller, it takes in
params[:query]. When you sent in queryVal alone, it'd be {"c" => nil },
{ "cu" => nil}, etc. When you sent in {queryVal}, it'd make it so it was
{"queryVal" => "c"}.. which is also incorrect, because params is looking for query.
So the variable name had to be query for it to be { "query" => "c" }. Well, that
wasted an awful lot of time.

#attr to give <a> tag an href
Automatically adds the path + users/. Could just hardcode with /users/${user.id},
though! Doesn't really make a difference.

How does user get the #followed attribute? Where the hell is it coming from?
It comes from the json.jbuilder file!
